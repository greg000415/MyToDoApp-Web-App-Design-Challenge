# MyToDoApp-Web-App-Design-Challenge

## This project is a to-do list project that allows a user to make note of tasks they would like to complete. The project allows the user to perform the following tasks:

*View/READ a list of all available tasks they have made note of.
*Add/CREATE tasks to their list of tasks.
*Edit/UPDATE specific task names.
*Remove/DELETE tasks task they nolonger deem not necessary to complete.

##Guidelines to using the app:

*When the page loads, the app displays header section, an input field to enter a task name and a button to add the task to the list next to the input and a list of all available tasks if any have been previously added. Each task is accompanied by buttons to mark as complete, delete task and update task. 
*To CREATE a new task, the user must enter a task name into the input field and click the "Add Task To List" button or press enter on their keyboard.
*To UPDATE an existing task, the user must click the last/3rd icon on the same row as the task they would like to update, click on the task to activate the text area to allow them to make the changes then click "Update" when done making the necessary changes.
*To DELETE a task on the list, the user must click the middle/2nd icon on the smae row as the task they would like to delete.
*I had a hard time implementing the functionality to allow the user to mark tasks as complete, so the check icon does not perfom any function when clicked.
